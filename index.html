    "You are very thoughtful. You always surprise me with how deep you take yourself into certain topics. You display great listening behavior and always ask great questions!",
    "You are the best chef I know! I’m someone who cooks in a way that’s convenient for me, but you set a high standard for quality and I respect you so much for that. Also as you like to say, someone who wants to be a great chef must first understand how to taste :)",
    "You go above and beyond for your friends and family. Without being asked to, without showing any annoyance or inconvenience, you will perform acts to help others out. You’re amazing for that!",
    "You give the best hugs! When I’m tired, it’s your big bear hugs that make me feel so safe and warm.",
    "I love your face. Do i say this enough? You are so adorable. ",
    "You don’t show any hesitation toward sharing. It’s like it’s an automatic response. Maybe it comes from your family too. I love that you share food, you share gatekept spots (only if you are going to haha), you share your recent interests, you share your friends and family. Relationships are great because we can enjoy double!! Thank you for sharing your time and valuable things with me :)",
    "You have a great memory. You’re so good at remembering small moments we shared in the past, and when you bring them up it tells me you value every moment we spend together.",
    "I like that you have the same passion for design as me! Turning this passion into a career is nice but hard at times, and I’m glad there’s someone who understands. also if I have to rant about work you will know what I'm talking about (like components on figma….)",
    "You are very good with your words :0 I think you’re creative with how you phrase things, and often your texts make me blush or laugh.",
    "I love how you love music. I mean, I would never get close to someone who doesn’t like music as much as I do, but I'm glad you’re someone who has the same appreciation for music (both listening and playing!)",
    "I’m so grateful you have an appreciation for Japanese culture. It’s so cool that you’re learning Japanese on Duolingo, and that you have a lot of knowledge about Japanese music, food, anime, etc. I think my family loves you for that too!",
    "I love that you’re well-connected to your Chinese heritage. I don’t thinks it’s recognized enough how impressive and important it is to connect back to your roots. I’m also grateful that you share it with me! And thank you for always ordering at Chinese restaurants, I trust that you will order the best of the best.",
    "You are so patient. maybe it seems like you have a lot of patience compared to how less I have it haha. Thank you for keeping up with my moodiness and being understanding of what I need at the moment. I’m sorry for making things difficult sometimes.",
    "Your spontaneity gives me a lot of excitement. I’m used to feeling like I need a strict schedule to make the most out of something, but I've learned through you that sometimes it’s better to leave things to the flow. That way there could be more unexpected surprises!",
    "You’re a great driver! I like that you’re very confident with that. Thank you for driving me everywhere whenever I'm back home.",
    "I love that there's a difference between your goofy, funny side and your serious, genuine side. Sometimes it makes me feel there's a side of you that you only show to me, and it makes me feel special. I know there are a lot of thoughts that lie within you, and I appreciate you sharing them with me time to time!",
    "Whenever there's a moment you want to remember, I love that you pull out your phone to capture it! I've talked about this before, but it's something I've noticed since we were at Chapman. It gave me the impression that you value the time you spend with friends, and want those memories to live on forever!",
    "It's very cool how you're good at building things. I'm usually not used to doing hands-on things, so I have so much respect to that talent of yours! Thank you for helping me build that shelf that one time hehe",
    "I think the fact that you've had several jobs in the past makes you even more interesting. It probably has built part of your character and attitude towards things, and also it's fun listening to your previous work stories!",
    "I like that you always have a jacket/coat in your car. It shows that you're prepared. And you always offer it to me when it's cold outside, which is so sweet!!!",
    "You are so kind to Peanut!!! You say you want to give him away, but I always see you giving him so much love and I love watching you pet him and walk him. He must love you so much, no matter what you say!!",
    "I love how you are great at making decisions. As someone who struggles so much about choosing what's best, it's pretty awesome that I'm dating someone who will just go ahead and decide. And for food options, I love how you always keep it a secret!!",
    "You are super empathetic about people. It's cool how fascinated you are with how people think and feel, and it's what makes you a great person to be around!",
    "I deeply respect the way you digest problems and offer solutions. You're very careful with analyzing situations and coming up with ways we can navigate problems, which is definitely not my strong suit. It's also great just having those productive conversations and listening to your thoughts!",
    "You are quite the gentleman. When you do acts of service for me, it makes me giggle and squeal because I feel so loved and cherished!! <3",
    "You've maintained the same friendships for a very long time, which is such a green flag!! And it's true that one's friends reveal a lot about that person, because all of your friends are so nice and funny, and I understand why you're close with them :)",
    "I respect how careful you are with your friends. I remember the conversation we had before where you grew up not trusting words entirely. You take time to walkthrough your thoughts and build up the right words, which makes each and every word hold a lot of meaning. No matter if it's in person, on call, or over text, I love and care for all the words you share with me.",
    "You are very confident and forward when it comes to physical touch... I love being guided and feeling taken care of... tehehe <3"
    "I'm so glad you're a tea lover. I've always loved tea, but I feel like I appreciate more now that I'm dating you!! I love how there's so many varieties of tea, and it helps me relax! I love all the times we sat down and had tea while we talked :)"
